### Components
Components are probably the most important thing to learn from React/Next.js. Components are defined the same way as pages are. They are functions that can take in optional arguments called props.
<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    import Image from 'next/image';
    import styles from '@styles/content/examples/studentID.module.scss';

    export default function StudentID(props) {
        const { name, img, bday } = props;
        return (
            <div className={styles.container}>
                <h1>{name}</h1>
                <Image src={img} alt={`picture of ${name}`} width="200px" />
                <p>{bday}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
</CodeBlock>

The above code defines a component called StudentID which takes in three arguments (name, img, bday) and displays that information in a predefined template.

&nbsp;  
A shorter way to destructure the props is to just destructure it in the arguments field.
<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    import Image from 'next/image';
    import styles from '@styles/content/examples/studentID.module.scss';

    export default function StudentID({ name, img, bday }) {
        return (
            <div className={styles.container}>
                <h1>{name}</h1>
                <Image src={img} alt={`picture of ${name}`} width="200px" />
                <p>{bday}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
</CodeBlock>

So how do we use this component? Just treat the component like an existing HTML element that takes in props.
<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    <StudentID name="Austin Shih" bday="May 7, 2003" img="/content/turtle.png"/>
    ```
</CodeBlock>
<StudentID name={"Austin Shih"} bday={"May 7, 2003"} img="/content/turtle.png"/>

#### Try it out!
For the next 3 sections, we will be building out a basic dropdown menu.

<DropDownMenu name="My Menu"/>  
&nbsp;  

Setup:
1. Create a file --> /components/projects/dropDownMenu.jsx
2. Create a file --> /styles/projects/dropDownMenu.module.scss
3. Link the stylying and have the function return something simple for now.
4. import this in the projects page and call it in the return function so you can see the component displayed in /projects  
&nbsp;  

Once you're all set up, follow these steps:
1. Create a div to contain the dropdown menu
2. The dropdown menu can be broken up into the button and the links. Create both a button/div for the button part and a div to contain a list of links.
3. Hardcode the list of links inside your links div.
<CodeBlock> 
```jsx
<Link href="/">home</Link> 
```
</CodeBlock>
4. Have your component take in a prop that changes the large text in the button. I name my prop ```name``` but you can name it whatever you want.
<CodeBlock> 
```jsx
<h3>{name}</h3>
```
</CodeBlock>
5. Add in the up arrow. For the up arrow, use the following lines. react-icons turns them into Components. You can change the size of the arrow by setting the ```font-size``` attribute in CSS. It is also fine to give the arrow a className and style it as if it's text.
<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    import { AiFillCaretDown, AiFillCaretUp } from 'react-icons/ai';

    // in html...
    <AiFillCaretUp />
    or
    <AiFillCaretUp className={styles.arrow}/>
    ```
</CodeBlock>

6. Once the structure is set up, add in classes where neccesary and style with CSS! I tend to just use flexbox for everything.
