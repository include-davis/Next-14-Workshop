### Intro to Next.js
&nbsp;

Next.js is a fullstack framework built on top of React.js. This workshop will focus on the frontend aspect.  
&nbsp;
#### First all of, why React?  
&nbsp;

React allows you to:
1. Simpliy your javascript for dynamic sites
2. Create custom HTML blocks that you can reuse  
&nbsp;

#### Why Next.js?
1. Easy serverless backend
2. File system page routing
3. Layout system
4. Serverside rendering
5. Optimized Image and Link tags  
&nbsp;

These are just a few of the benefits.  
&nbsp;

#### app folder  
&nbsp;

The app folder is where you define application routes and layout. To define a new route, create a folder and the name of the folder will be the new route! Each route can take in a page.jsx and a layout.jsx. **Page** is where you define what will be displayed by that route. **Layout** is where you define a shared styling which is applied to the route where it's defined and also all child routes.  
&nbsp;

#### styles folder  
&nbsp;

This is where all of our css modules will be stored.  
&nbsp;

#### components folder  
&nbsp;

This is where all the reusable components are stored.  
&nbsp;

#### data  
&nbsp;

This is something I added to store json objects that define the configuration of certain pages.  
&nbsp;

#### public  
&nbsp;

Public is full of publicly accessible files. This means that if someone were to inspect your webpage upon deployment, these files are viewable. Don't put anything important here. Usually, people store things like images here since those are meant to be displayed anyways.
