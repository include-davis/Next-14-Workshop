### Mapping - JS map function
Imagine you are UC Davis and you just received 3000 new students. For some reason, you want to display StudentID previews for each student in a webpage. One solution is to just brute force it.

<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    import StudentID from "@components/content/examples/studentID";

    const students = [
        {
            name: "student 1",
            bday: "...",
            img: "..."
        },
        {
            name: "student 2",
            bday: "...",
            img: "..."
        },
        ...
    ]
    export default function Students() {
        return (
            <div>
                <StudentID name={students[0].name} bday={students[0].bday} img={students[0].name}/>
                ...
                <StudentID name={students[10].name} bday={students[10].bday} img={students[10].name} />
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
</CodeBlock>

This is obviously a terrible solution. You would have to copy and paste so much code. Imagine if StudentIDs got a new look one day and there was an additional field for "college". You would have to go through every line of code you pasted and add in that new prop.

The better way is to use the map function. React interprets lists of HTML objects as if they were just listed out in the HTML structure.

<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    export default function Example() {
        return (
            <div>
                [<p>text in html</p>, <p>text in html</p>]
            </div>
        );
    }

    // same as above
    export default function Example() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>text in html</p>
                <p>text in html</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```
</CodeBlock>

This allows us to use the map function to transform each element in a list into HTML, then pass it into the HTML structure and have them all display as if they were pasted in one by one.


<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    import StudentID from "@components/content/examples/studentID";

    const students = [
        {
            name: "student 1",
            bday: "...",
            img: "..."
        },
        {
            name: "student 2",
            bday: "...",
            img: "..."
        },
        ...
    ]
    export default function Students() {
      return (
        <div>
          {
            students.map((student, index) => {
              return (<StudentID 
                        key={student.name} // required by Next.js
                        name={student.name} 
                        bday={student.bday} 
                        img={students.img}
                    />) 
              }
            )
          }
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
</CodeBlock>

Notice that I also included a key prop. When you use the map function in Next.js, you need to include a key or else Next will throw a warning. The key prop has to be unique. This means something like a student_id number would be good, but names are not a good key since not all names are unique.

Let's try running this code with the following list:
<CodeBlock>
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Austin Shih",
        "img": "/examples/turtle.png",
        "bday": "May 7"
    },
    {
        "name": "Brandon Wong",
        "img": "/examples/turtle.png",
        "bday": "May 7"
    }
]
```
</CodeBlock>

<StudentID name={"Austin Shih"} bday={"May 7"} img="/content/turtle.png"/>
<StudentID name={"Brandon Wong"} bday={"May 7"} img="/content/turtle.png"/>  
&nbsp;

#### Try it out!
Now, instead of hardcoding these links, let's use the map function to do it.

<DropDownMenu name="My Menu"/>  
&nbsp;

1. Add the following code to your app/projects/page.jsx file. (Between the import statement and the function declaration)
<CodeBlock>
    ```jsx
    const dropDownLinks = [
        {
            text: "home",
            slug: "/"
        },
        {
            text: "content",
            slug: "/content"
        },
        {
            text: "projects",
            slug: "/projects"
        }
    ]
    ```
</CodeBlock>
2. Create a new prop for the linkData and pass it through to the DropDownMenu. Once again, you can name it whatever you want.
3. Replace the hardcoded ```<Link />``` tags by using the map function.
